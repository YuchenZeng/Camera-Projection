The code has 7 script files
main.m -> this is the one you will be executing to do all the stuff
parallel_computing.m -> this one will do all the computations using parallel computing tool box
for_loop.m -> this one functions the same as <parallel_computing.m>. But without parallel computing.
save_vue2.m -> this script plot dots on the vue2 frames and save it as a .avi video file
save_vue4.m -> this script plot dots on the vue4 frames and save it as a .avi video file
save_3d.m -> this one plots reconstruced 3d points and generate a video.

these script can't be run individually or directly. You must run <main.m>. All other scripts are used in the <main.m>
There are several parameters you may change in the <main.m>. Please refer to details in the script.
